--->Hi there 👋
My name is Jeremy, I am 23 years old and I love programming. I started programming at 16. In my github you will probably find my non-organised projects so excuse me for that 😅. However, I hope I can help with my projects.

⚒ The minecraft server project:
We worked with some friends on a minecraft server. I made the Moderation Plugin, the Pitchout Plugin ( You have a knockback stick and you need to push people off the platform ), the Arena Plugin ( FFA ) and with a friend we made the Survival Plugin ( A survival a bit like the city of the elements made by siphano )

💎 The websites I made:
Teska Skateboards (It is a webshop for a company selling skateboards and t-shirts)
Pupils' Committee of EEB3 (I made the pupils' committee website of my school)
Bal Du Bac 2022 (A small website created to manage the sales of the anual bal of our school)
🔭 I’m currently working on:
Some minecraft plugins
A simple MVC php framework for my future websites
Mini python scripts for windows
🌱 I’m currently learning:
PHP Laravel
React.js
